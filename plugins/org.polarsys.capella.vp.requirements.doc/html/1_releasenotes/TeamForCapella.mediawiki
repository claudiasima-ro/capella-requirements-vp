In the context of Team for Capella product, the import from a connected project is not supported

The recommended process is :

* Launch Reqif Import on a local project
* Export the project to the server.
* Backup the .capella.bridgetraces file for the next import since the file created while the reqif import is not exported to the server.

=== Once model is exported to the server, to import Reqif again ===

* Import the remote project to a local project
* Put inside the project the .capella.bridgetraces file kept from the previous import
* Launch Reqif Import on the local project
* Re-Export the project to the server.
* Backup the .capella.bridgetraces file for the next import
